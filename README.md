# Digi Notes — AI-powered handwritten notes platform

Monorepo scaffold for an AI system that extracts, structures, and surfaces handwritten academic notes as study aids (OCR → LLM → Knowledge Graph → Flashcards).

Structure overview and quick start are in `docs/setup_guide.md`.

This repository contains three main services:
- `frontend/` — React Native app
- `backend/` — Node.js API gateway
- `ai/` — Python FastAPI service for OCR, semantic parsing, and graph building

See `docs/` for architecture and API specs.
