Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. The process occurs in two main stages:

1. Light-dependent reactions: These occur in the thylakoid membranes and produce ATP and NADPH.
2. Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle): These occur in the stroma and use ATP and NADPH to fix CO2 into glucose.

Key Formula:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

Important Concepts:
- Chloroplast: Organelle where photosynthesis occurs
- Chlorophyll: Green pigment that absorbs light
- Stomata: Pores for gas exchange
